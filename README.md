# Introduction

This project replicates the pipeline described in the article "Integrative Analysis of Clinical and Bioinformatics Databases to Reveal the Role of Peripheral Innate Immunity in Kawasaki Disease" by Hongjun Ba, Lili Zhang, Huimin Peng, Jixun Lin, Youzhen Qin, and Yao Wang. Our goal was to replicate the methodology, analyze their results, and evaluate the findings.

# Project Approach

Each team member contributed by independently implementing the pipeline described in the paper, using their own scripts. After completing our individual analyses, we discussed together to compare results and discuss the outcomes. This collaborative approach allowed us to explore diverse methods and validate the reproducibility of the study.

# Project description

### Study background and goal

Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an immune-response disorder characterized by acute inflammation of blood vessels. Despite its prevalence, the underlying mechanisms of KD remain poorly understood. Immune cells have been implicated in KD, yet their specific roles are unclear. Current treatments, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy—a solution of antibodies—are not universally effective, with some patients showing no significant response.

The goal of this study is to investigate the role of innate immunity in KD progression and assess its potential as a predictor of treatment response.

### Study conclusions

The study by Ba et al. (2023) revealed that myeloid cells, particularly CD14+ CD16+ intermediate monocytes, exhibit heterogeneity and express inflammatory genes during the acute stage of KD. The findings confirmed that innate immunity plays a critical role in KD progression.

### Input database

The study utilized scRNA-seq and RNA microarray datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database:

* Microarray Datasets:

    * GSE18606: 9 healthy controls, 20 acute KD patients

    * GSE63881: 171 KD patients before IVIG treatment (110 responders, 61 non-responders)

* scRNA-seq Datasets:

    * GSE168732: Whole blood peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 3 healthy controls (H1, H2, H3) and 6 KD patients (P1–P6)

    * GSE152450: Monocyte heterogeneity in 2 healthy controls and 2 KD infants

* Total cells: ~49,000 (Control + KD patients)

### Project Output: 

The project replicated Figures 1 and 2 from the original article.

# Our Approach

### 1. Preparing Data

1. Prepare the cellranger output files for each sample. Three files are generated by `cellranger count` (`barcodes.tsv.gz`, `features.tsv.gz`, `matrix.mtx.gz`). 

### 2. Analysis of scRNA sequencing data. 

#### Data Integration

* The script first integrates the data. 
    
* Created the CreateSeuratObject function with parameters of 

    * min.cell = 3
    * min.features = 200 
    * UMI cutoff range: 2,000–60,000
    * Mitochondrial gene percentage: <5%

 * For P1 (before therapy), adjusted the UMI cutoff to 1,000 due to its lower median UMI count. 

 #### Dimensionality Reduction

 * Applied PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE for data visualization, replicating Figure 1 from the paper.

#### Clustering and Visualization

* Identified clusters using `FindNeighbors` and `FindClusters` with a resolution of 0.8, producing 27 clusters.

* Visualized clusters with UMAP, grouped by sample and condition.

### 3. Cell Annotation

* Using SingleR and five reference datasets (human primary cell atlas, Blueprint/ENCODE, Database of Immune Cell Expression, Novershtern hematopoietic data and Monaco immune data) to annotate Seurat clusters. 

### 4. Differential Expression Analysis. 

 * Identifying markers with `FindAllMarkers` and selecting top markers per cluster for comparison. 

### 5. AUC and Gene Set Enrichment. 

* Calculated enrichment scores for immune-related genes using AUCell.

* Performed Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses on differentially expressed genes.

# Results Analysis

### 1. Reproductibility 

Ba et al. (2023) did not publish their code so it was challenging to develop the pipeline based on their . They relied heavily on a public GitHub repository from Wang et al. (2021), which analyzed scRNA-seq data of PBMCs from acute KD patients before and after IVIG therapy. 

This GitHub repo was also vague when dividing the samples into two batches, with batch 1 containing P1-4 and H1-3, and the second batch contained P5-6 and included a P7 that couldn't be found anywhere in the materials. 

### 2. Our conclusions

* min.features = 200 looks too low for all samples

* UMI threshold ranging from 2,000 to 60,000 seems poor. P1 lower threshold seems to create loss of data. Remaining thresholds are uninformative

* The authors annotated according to a specific set of marker genes that were unclear to us. Our cell cluster labels, cluster distribution across healthy and diseased patients did not match the authors' labels. 

* Technical issues occured when we recreated the paper's plots.
